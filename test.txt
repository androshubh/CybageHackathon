It is my pleasure to present this B.E. Computer Engineering Syllabus.  The syllabus is a blend of concepts and
advances using high end FOSS technologies.  One of the objectives of the this syllabus is to cultivate students
for  using  FOSS  and  contributions  in  FOSS.  The  theory  subjects  are  based  on  the  pre-requisites  covered  in
 rst year to third Year computer engineering.  16 electives are divided into four groups on recent technologies
such as cloud computing, mobile computing, web applications and Business Analytic and Intelligence, Cyber
Security are provided which shall be useful for student in their professional carrier.
The laboratories for problem solving practices are based on utilization of state-of-the art FOSS software Tech-
nologies used by the Industries.  The FOSS technologies are available with source code students can experiment
the performance improvement and ideation to replace the existing implementation.  The Project can be done as
conventional practices or as an entrepreneur project to give thrust on generating budding talent as entrepreneur
to lead the industrial front of the nation worldwide.
